# RAG-internship-
This is a working version of a RAG agent I developed during my internship at QED. Unfortunately we didn't have enough time to make the multiple agent architecture work. I planned on making one ReAct agent a supervisor, having 3 sequential agents use tools for reaserch and then having one last ReAct agent generate final response.
